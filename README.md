Just drag-and-drop any image file (tested with `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`) into the window.
You can resize the window and drop another image to change the contents.

To close the window click the window and press `ESC`.
Or you can hit the invisible close button.
It's there. It's just invisible.

Requires vanilla.

You can install the modules in `Glyphs>Preferences>Addons>Modules>Install Modules`

## TODO:

- Dragging the window regardless where user starts dragging.
